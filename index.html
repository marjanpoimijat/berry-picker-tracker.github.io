            Find your way in the Finnish forests
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Berry Picker Tracker</b> is an application designed to help people who have gotten
            lost in the Finnish forests. Every year, around 15,000 people go missing in Finland,
            and a large portion of them are berry pickers. Finding people in the forest consumes
            time and resources, and typically involves the use of drones, helicopters, tracking
            dogs, and volunteer searchers.
          </p>
           <p>
            The Berry Picker Tracker app allows you to conviniently see your coordinates and the 
            path you have walked. With the share route button, you can share location with family 
            members or others allowing them to track your route on the "Tracking" screen. The app
            features multiple map types, a battery saving mode, and a user to user encryption system 
            to ensure privacy. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile app is built using React Native and Expo. It connects to a backend API, which is 
            written in Python. The backend is used for storage, sharing routes, and to provide map tiles.
            The backend is currently deployed on the University of Helsinki Staging Server.
          </p>
         
          <p>
            The application is being developed by a group of students at the University of Helsinki.

          <p>
            The development of the Berry Picker Tracker app was started by a group of six students
            as part of the University of Helsinki software development project course in autumn
            2022. It's a hands-on course that focuses on practical experience in agile software
            development. Students work in teams to develop a project from start to finish, applying
            agile principles and practices along the way. The course emphasizes the importance of
            working collaboratively, communicating effectively, and adapting to change. By the end
            of the course, students will have developed a project as members of a team, gaining
            valuable experience in agile software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of spring 2023, the application is being further developed by another group of seven
            students.
