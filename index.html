            Find your way in the Finnish forests
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Berry Picker Tracker</b> is an application designed to help people who have gotten
            lost in the Finnish forests. Every year, around 15,000 people go missing in Finland,
            and a large portion of them are berry pickers. Finding people in the forest consumes
            time and resources, and typically involves the use of drones, helicopters, tracking
            dogs, and volunteer searchers.
          </p>
           <p>
            The Berry Picker Tracker app allows you to conviniently see your coordinates and the 
            path you have walked. With the share route button, you can share location with family 
            members or others allowing them to track your route on the "Tracking" screen. The app
            features multiple map types, a battery saving mode, and a user to user encryption system 
            to ensure privacy. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The mobile app is built using React Native and Expo. It connects to a backend API, which is 
            written in Python. The backend is used for storage, sharing routes, and to serve map tiles.
            The backend is currently deployed on the University of Helsinki Staging Server.
