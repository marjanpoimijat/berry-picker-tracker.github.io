            Find your way in the Finnish forests
          </h2>
          <p>
            <b>Berry Picker Tracker</b> is an application designed to help people who have gotten
            lost in the Finnish forests. Every year, around 15,000 people go missing in Finland,
            and a large portion of them are berry pickers. Finding people in the forest consumes
            time and resources, and typically involves the use of drones, helicopters, tracking
            dogs, and volunteer searchers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This application aims to make it easier for people to track their location and share it
            with others. The front-end of the application is built with React Native. The back-end
            is written in Python and runs on a virtual machine provided by the University of
            Helsinki. The app uses a detailed topographical map provided by the National Land Survey
            of Finland.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Berry Picker Tracker app, you can see your coordinates, and your route is drawn
            on the topographic map. You can share your user ID with family members or others
            allowing them to track your route on the "Find User's Route" screen. The app also has
            many settings to help you save battery life. The application is available in several
            languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is being developed by a group of students at the University of Helsinki.

          <p>
            The development of the Berry Picker Tracker app was started by a group of six students
            as part of the University of Helsinki software development project course in autumn
            2022. It's a hands-on course that focuses on practical experience in agile software
            development. Students work in teams to develop a project from start to finish, applying
            agile principles and practices along the way. The course emphasizes the importance of
            working collaboratively, communicating effectively, and adapting to change. By the end
            of the course, students will have developed a project as members of a team, gaining
            valuable experience in agile software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of spring 2023, the application is being further developed by another group of seven
            students.
